      The Arctic Orthopedic Summit offers a top-tier scientific program with
      keynote lectures, workshops, and panel discussions on orthopedic surgery,
      trauma care, and sports medicine. Participants can engage with global
      experts and gain practical skills. Beyond the sessions, attendees can
      enjoy Arctic Circle activities like skiing, husky sledding, Northern
      Lights viewing, and traditional Finnish saunas. The event culminates with
      a casual Gala Dinner on March 19, 2024, at a secret location. Now in its
      24th edition, the summit combines professional growth with cultural
      experiences in Lapland for an unforgettable event.
